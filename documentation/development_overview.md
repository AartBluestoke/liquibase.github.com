# LiquiBase Development #

Like all open-source projects, we encourage looking at the code, suggesting ideas, and even implementing fixes and improvements.

The LiquiBase code is hosted on Jira's SVN repository can be checked out through SVN with the following command:

<nowiki>svn co http://liquibase.jira.com/svn/CORE/trunk liquibase</nowiki>

If you are interested in contributing to LiquiBase, please contact us via the [mailing list](../community).
