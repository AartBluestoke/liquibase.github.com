Documentation for the liquibase.org site.

Please send pull requests!

The Liquibase site is hosted using GitHub Pages, and generated using 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Pages are written in MarkDown documents, making
use of [Liquid template tags](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/).

If you're using a MarkDown editor with a "live preview" feature, be aware that
it's unlikely to support Liquid's syntax highlighting tags, such as 
"{% highlight xml %}".
