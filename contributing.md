# Contributing to LiquiBase #

Like any open source application, LiquiBase is built by many people, usually in their spare time.  While we are proud of what we have accomplished so far, there is still much to do and we are always looking for new people to help out.  

## Coding ##

As a software application, there is always a need for coding.  Take a look at the [[community.html|issue tracker]] or [[community.html|future directions]] page for ideas on what needs to be done or tackle something that you have noticed could use improving.  Both patches and simple pointers on how to improve or fix the code are always appreciated.  If you have questions on how the code works, visit the [[manual/Architecture.html]] page or contact the [[community.html|liquibase-devel]] mailing list.

## Documentation ##

Face it, we all like coding more than documenting.  To the end user, however, the documentation is what makes a tool usable.  The liquibase.org site is implemented as a wiki to allow anyone to quickly and easily add to and fix the site, so feel free.


## Translation ##

75% of the liquibase.org traffic is from non-English users.  If you are interested in [[wiki/translation/about.html|translating]] sections (or even single pages) of the site, feel free to do so.  If you have any questions, contact the [[community.html|liquibase-doc]] mailing list.

[[http://www.liquibase.org/de/home|German]], [[http://www.liquibase.org/fr/home|French]], and [[http://www.liquibase.org/pt/home|Portuguese]] are in the most need of translators.  

## Evangelizing ##

Love LiquiBase?  Tell your friends.  Blog us.  We don't have an advertising budget, so word of mouth is what we need.  

## User Feedback ##

If you find a bug or know of a feature that would be useful to you, [[community.html|let us know]].  We try to guess at what end-users want and need, but real feedback from real users is extremely valuable and makes LiquiBase better for everyone.

## Donation ##

Tips are never expected, but always appreciated.  All donations go toward LiquiBase hosting and development costs. <phpinc=donate.html>
