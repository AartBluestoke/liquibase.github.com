# Feature Ideas #

The best way to get starting developing for LiquiBase is to work on a particular bug or feature that would help you.

If you don't know what would help, here are some ideas:
  * DSL alternative(s) to the XML-based changelog
  * Improvements to [[../manual/diff]] tool
  * [[../dotnetport|.Net port]]
  * Integration with Rails
  * Improve [[../manual/Grails]] integration
  * Javadoc improvement
  * Documentation/samples of [[http://liquibase.org/extensions|extensions]]
  * More change tags ([[http://www.agiledata.org/essays/databaseRefactoringCatalog.html|ideas]]
  * Additional [[../databases|database support]]
  * Unit test improvements
