# Feature Ideas #

The best way to get starting developing for Liquibase is to work on a particular bug or feature that would help you.

If you don't know what would help, here are some ideas:
  * DSL alternative(s) to the XML-based changelog
  * [.Net port](../dotnetport.html)
  * Integration with Rails
  * Javadoc improvement
  * Documentation/samples of [http://liquibase.org/extensions](http://liquibase.org/extensions)
  * More change tags ([ideas](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/databaseRefactoringCatalog.html)
  * Additional [database support](../databases.html)
  * Unit test improvements
