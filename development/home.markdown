Like all open-source projects, we encourage looking at the code, suggesting ideas, and even implementing fixes and improvements.

===== Source Code =====

The LiquiBase code can be browsed at [[http://liquibase.jira.com/source/browse/CORE]] or checked out in SVN from http://liquibase.jira.com/svn/CORE/trunk.

To enable easier and more accurate patch submission, anyone with an account at [[http://liquibase.jira.com]] can commit to the repository.  All commits are reviewed by a member of the LiquiBase team and will be modified and/or reverted if need be.  If you would prefer to [[/community|submit changes]] by the traditional "patch" format, that is fine as well.

===== Issue Tracking =====

Bugs and features are managed at [[http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE]].  If you have a specific feature or bug, logging it in jira is the best approach.  It allows us to track it and for you to watch it better than on the general forum.  If you are unsure if it is a bug or want more discussion around it, [[/community|post it as a question]].
