Like all open-source projects, we encourage looking at the code, suggesting ideas, and even implementing fixes and improvements.

## Issue Tracking ##

Bugs and features are managed at [http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE](http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE).  If you have a specific feature or bug, logging it in jira is the best approach.  It allows us to track it and for you to watch it better than on the general forum.  If you are unsure if it is a bug or want more discussion around it, [post it as a question](/community.html).
