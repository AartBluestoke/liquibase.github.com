# Liquibase Development

As an open-source projects, we encourage looking any help you can give to the project.

## Source Code ##

The main Liquibase source repository is at [http://github.com/liquibase/liquibase](http://github.com/liquibase/liquibase). To contribute changes, fork the Liquibase repository and send us your pull requests. See [Github help](https://help.github.com/) for more information.

Other Liquibase-related projects and extensions (including this site's source) can be found at [http://github.com/liquibase](http://github.com/liquibase/liquibase)

## Issue Tracking ##

Bugs and features are managed at [http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE](http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE).  If you have a specific feature or bug, logging it in jira is the best approach.  It allows us to track it and for you to watch it better than on the general forum.  If you are unsure if it is a bug or want more discussion around it, [post it as a question](../community/index.html).

## Contributing to Liquibase #

Like any open source application, Liquibase is built by many people, usually in their spare time.  While we are proud of what we have accomplished so far, there is still much to do and we are always looking for new people to help out.

### Coding ##

As a software application, there is always a need for coding.  Take a look at the [German](../community/index.html) mailing list.

### Documentation ##

Face it, we all like coding more than documenting.  To the end user, however, the documentation is what makes a tool usable.  The liquibase.org site is implemented as a wiki to allow anyone to quickly and easily add to and fix the site, so feel free.

### Evangelizing ##

Love Liquibase?  Tell your friends.  Blog us.  We don't have an advertising budget, so word of mouth is what we need.

### User Feedback ##

If you find a bug or know of a feature that would be useful to you, [let us know](../community/index.html).  We try to guess at what end-users want and need, but real feedback from real users is extremely valuable and makes Liquibase better for everyone.
