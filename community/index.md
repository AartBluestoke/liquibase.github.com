# Liquibase User and Developer Community #

## Forums ##

The purpose of the forums is to be a place for general purpose discussion, questions, and feedback.
If you believe you found a bug or have a specific feature request, you should enter it in Jira.
If you have a code change, you should create a pull request on github.

**Available Forums**
- [Liquibase Users](http://forum.liquibase.org/#Forum/liquibase-users) for topics related to using Liquibase and writing extensions.
- [Liquibase Developers](http://forum.liquibase.org/#Forum/liquibase-development) for topics related to working on the Liquibase codebase.

## Bug and Feature Tracking ##

Bugs and feature requests should be entered directly into [Liquibase Jira](http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE) so they can be tracked better than is possible as a user forum question.

## Code ##

The Liquibase source is hosted at [https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase). Code submissions should go through the standard GitHub pull request system.
For more information, see the [developer documentation](../development/index.html)

## Project Lead ##

You can email the Nathan Voxland, Liquibase creator and project lead at nathan.voxland@liquibase.org

## Commercial training and support ##

Commercial training and support beyond what is available in the forums is available at [liquibase.com](http://liquibase.com)
